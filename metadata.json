    "Description": "ChemGPT (4.7M params) is a language-based transformer model for generative molecular modeling, which was pretrained on the PubChem10M dataset. Pre-trained ChemGPT models are also robust, self-supervised representation learners that generalize to previously unseen regions of chemical space and enable embedding-based nearest-neighbor search. Here we provide the implementation by DataMol.\n",
